#### Recursion

So this project in The Odin Project tested my abilities with recursion, something that always made my mind boggle a little bit. Still makes my mind boggle a bit but I feel a bit more confident with using it, and I hope to get to use it more in the future with my study of DSA.

First task was classic fibonacci, nothing really to say here, basically every programming book has this in there to show you how recursion works in any given language.

Now we get to do the merge sort, which funny enough the recursion part is actually super straightforward, the merging part was tricky. I wanted to avoid using a double for loop for reasons, then broke down and tried using one and funny enough, I couldn't get it to work. So I had a while loop, and good ole pushing and popping(shifting in this case) until I merged the two together. Not the most mindful of memory as I'm creating a ton of different arrays, but let's call that good enough for today.
